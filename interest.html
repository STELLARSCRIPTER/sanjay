            <p>LaTeX is a powerful tool for typesetting complex mathematical documents. My proficiency in LaTeX helps me present mathematical concepts clearly and professionally.</p>
            <p>Example of LaTeX code:</p>
            <pre><code>\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
    \title{Sample Document}
    \author{Author Name}
    \maketitle
    \section{Introduction}
    This is a sample document.
\end{document}
